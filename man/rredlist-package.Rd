\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

'IUCN' Red List (\url{https://api.iucnredlist.org/}) client. The 'IUCN' Red List is a global list of threatened and endangered species. Functions cover all of the Red List 'API' routes. An 'API' key is required.
}
\section{Authentication}{

IUCN requires you to get your own API key, an alphanumeric string that you
need to send in every request. See key A IUCN API token. See \code{\link[=rl_use_iucn]{rl_use_iucn()}}
for help getting and storing it. Get it at
https://api.iucnredlist.org/users/sign_up
Keep this key private. You can pass the key in to each function via the
\code{key} parameter, but it's better to store the key either as a
environment variable (\code{IUCN_REDLIST_KEY}) or an R option
(\code{iucn_redlist_key}) - we recommend using the former option.

\section{High vs. Low level package APIs}{

\strong{High level API}
High level functions do the HTTP request and parse data to a data.frame for
ease of downstream use. The high level functions have no underscore on
the end of the function name, e.g., \code{\link[=rl_species]{rl_species()}}

\strong{Low level API}
The parsing to data.frame in the high level API does take extra time.
The low level API only does the HTTP request, and gives back JSON without
doing any more parsing. The low level functions DO have an underscore on
the end of the function name, e.g., \code{\link[=rl_species_]{rl_species_()}}
}

\section{No Spatial}{

This package does not include support for the spatial API, described at
https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/spatial
}

\section{Citing the Red List API}{

Get the proper citation for the version of the Red List you are using
by programatically running \code{\link[=rl_citation]{rl_citation()}}
}

\section{Red List API Terms of Use}{

See https://www.iucnredlist.org/terms/terms-of-use
}

\section{Rate limiting}{

From the IUCN folks: Too many frequent calls, or too many calls per day
might get your access blocked temporarily. If you're a heavy API user, the
Red List Unit asked that you contact them, as there might be better options.
They suggest a 2-second delay between your calls if you plan to make a
lot of calls.
