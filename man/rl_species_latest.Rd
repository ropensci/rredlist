\arguments{
\item{genus}{(character) The genus name of the species to look up.}

\item{species}{(character) The species epithet of the species to look up.}

\item{infra}{(character) An optional name of the subspecies or variety to
look up.}

separate subpopulation to look up.}

\description{
Get the latest assessment for a particular species (i.e., Latin binomial) or
subspecies/variety/subpopulation (i.e., Latin trinomial). Wraps
\code{\link[=rl_species]{rl_species()}} and \code{\link[=rl_assessment]{rl_assessment()}}.
}
\details{
Geographically separate subpopulations of a species are defined as
those populations that are so isolated from others of the same species that
it is considered extremely unlikely that there is any genetic interchange.
In general, listings of such subpopulations are restricted to those that
have been isolated for a long period of time.

Assessments of subspecies, varieties, and geographically separate
subpopulations must adhere to the same standards as for species
assessments. However, these assessments are only included provided there is
a global assessment of the species as a whole.

Infraspecific ranks such as formas, subvarieties, cultivars, etc are not
included in the Red List.
