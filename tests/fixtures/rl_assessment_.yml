        species can be found throughout the North Atlantic Ocean. In Europe, it occurs
        in north-west Greenland (to Denmark), and from north Norway down to the Canary
        Islands, Spain in the east (Nettleship \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e
        2014), and breeds primarily in Norway and Iceland, and also notably in the
        United Kingdom and the Faroe Islands.","population":"The European breeding
        population is estimated at 3,700,000-4,120,000 pairs, which equates to\u0026#160;7,400,000-8,240,000
        mature individuals. The breeding population in the EU28 is estimated at 601,000-602,000
        pairs, which equates to 1,200,000-1,210,000 mature individuals. For details
        of national estimates, see the Supplementary Information.","habitats":"The
        breeding range is restricted to colder parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans,
        with its southernmost colonies in Brittany (France).\u0026#160; Breeding colonies
        are located in Iceland, Norway, Faroe Islands, the U.K., Ireland and France
        on islands or high cliffs.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe species nests
        on grassy maritime slopes, sea cliffs and rocky slopes (Nettleship \u003cem\u003eet
        al.\u003c/em\u003e 2014). During the winter the species is highly pelagic
        and is dispersed widely across the sea from the Azores to the western Mediterranean
        and Canary Islands. When feeding chicks, birds generally forage within 10
        km of their colony, but may range as far as 50 to 100 km or more (Harris 1984,
        Rodway and Montevecchi 1996). Birds of this species are pursuit-divers that
        catch most of their prey within 30 m of the water surface (Piatt and Nettleship
        1985). They prey on ''forage'' species, including juvenile pelagic fishes,
        such as herring (\u003cem\u003eClupea harengus\u003c/em\u003e), juvenile and
        adult capelin (\u003cem\u003eMallotus villosus\u003c/em\u003e), and sand eel
        (\u003cem\u003eAmmodytes \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003espp.\u003c/em\u003e)
        (Barrett \u003cem\u003eet al. \u003c/em\u003e1987). At times, they also prey
        on juvenile demersal fishes, such as gadids (Harris and Hislop 1978, Martin
        1989, Rodway and Montevecchi 1996). Sand eels usually form the majority of
        the prey fed to chicks (Corkhill 1973, Hislop and Harris 1985, Harris and
        Wanless 1986, Harris and Riddiford 1989, Martin 1989), and many chicks starve
        during periods of low sand eel abundance (Martin 1989).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAlthough
        the generation length for both EU and Europe regional assessments were calculated
        using the same methodology, new information arriving after the EU assessments
        were undertaken gave rise to an update in the generation lengths. This new
        information was then used for the Europe level assessments giving rise to
        a difference between the generation lengths used for the EU and Europe regions.","threats":"This
        species is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as sea
        temperature rise and shifts in prey distribution and abundance (Durant \u003cem\u003eet
        al.\u003c/em\u003e 2003, Sandvik \u003cem\u003eet al. \u003c/em\u003e2005).
        This is a particularly important threat when prey species are exploited unsustainably,
        leading to prey reductions and subsequent unsuccessful breeding. The species
        is vulnerable to oil spills and other marine pollution. The species is also
        vulnerable to extreme weather events and storms, with large wrecks recorded
        following severe winter storms at sea. At the breeding colonies the species
        is vulnerable to invasive predators, such as rats, cats, and American Mink
        (\u003cem\u003eNeovison vison\u003c/em\u003e). The species is susceptible
        to being caught in gillnets, although other fishing gears may also catch significant
        numbers. Increasing numbers of offshore wind farms may result in displacement
        from habitat, although the risk of collision is considered very low (Bradbury
        \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e 2014). The species is hunted for human
        consumption in Iceland, and in the Faroe Islands (Thorup \u003cem\u003eet
        al.\u003c/em\u003e 2014).","measures":"\u003cstrong\u003eConservation Actions

        prepare National/European Community plans of action on seabird bycatch. Continue
        AMAP monitoring of seabird contaminants; include new contaminants and secure
        communication between seabird and contaminants research. Increase the level
        of understanding among the public of introducing hunting restrictions. Develop
        codes-of-conduct for more organised activities (e.g. tourism). Ensure that
