        Grey Wolves were found over most of Europe, including the British Isles. By
        the mid-20th century, their range was greatly reduced to remnants in northwest
        Iberia, central Italy, parts of the Baltics, the Carpathians, and the mountain
        areas of the Balkans. In the last 50 years, their range has greatly expanded
        with Grey Wolf presence being recorded in all continental European countries.
        The European Grey Wolf population is currently a large meta-population with
        several distinct populations, which can be described as follows (Chapron \u003cem\u003eet

        does not extend as far east as the Pyrenees (although some individuals are
        now recolonising the Pyrenees from the Alps, via France). Wolves are expanding
        southwards in Spain and are now found on both banks of the Duero River in
        both Spain and Portugal. The population segment in the Sierra Morena mountains

        border and occupying large areas of south-eastern France up to the Massif
        Central, and in Italy to lowlands of Piemonte and Liguria, also far from the
        Alps. Increasing numbers of wolves are found in Switzerland and in eastern
        Alpine regions of Italy, with numbers rapidly building up in Veneto, Friuli
        Venezia-Giulia and Trentino, and will likely further expand through most of
        the central Alps. Several packs have been formed by individuals from the Alps

        in Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.","population":"Due to the diversity
        in climate, topography, vegetation, patterns of human settlement and historical
        development of the wolf range, wolf populations in various parts of the original
        range vary dramatically in density. Wolf densities normally vary from about
        one per 12 km² to less than one per 120 km² (Mech and Boitani 2003). The overall
        European wolf population can be viewed as a large metapopulation with several
        distinct fragments, although dispersal could theoretically connect almost
        all fragments, and connections are being re-established in many areas. Following
        the bottleneck of the 1960s and 1970s, the European wolf population is generally
        increasing in number and expanding its distribution range. However, some European
        populations are still small and not all have more than 1,000 animals (see
        below for specific details). Dispersing animals can potentially be found anywhere
        in mainland Europe. The number of wolves in Europe (excluding Russia) is likely
        to exceed 21,500, and the total number of wolves in the EU 27 region is likely
        to be in the order of 19,000; some of the populations are continuous with
        wolf populations living in countries outside the EU.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e1.

        subspecies. After the population reduction up to the 1960s, it has increased
        dramatically since the 1970s and has been stable or slightly increasing in
        the last ten years and expanding its range across central Spain. The population
        occupies most of northwestern Iberia and is expanding south and east after
        having crossed the Duero River in Spain. There are two distinct population
        segments within this population. The largest is that north of the Duero River
        in both Spain and Portugal. South of the Duero in Portugal there is a small
        population segment of around 50 wolves which has only limited exchange of
        animals with the segments north of the Duero in Portugal and east to the Spanish
        segment south of the Duero.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe nearest wolf
        population is in the western Alps and connections between the two are limited
        to rare known cases. In the Pyrenees (regions of Cataluña and Aragón) there
        are currently a few non-reproducing wolves that have been genetically identified
        as members of the Alpine population from where they are assumed to have dispersed
        naturally (Alvares \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e 2015, Blanco and Cortés

        wolves. This population is of Italian Apennines origin and all wolves share
        the same distinctive Italian genetic haplotype. Individual wolves dispersing
        from the Apennines first colonised the Alps in 1992 and succeeded in establishing
        a permanent and expanding population which shows a highly dynamic spatial
        pattern spreading towards the west and north (and then to the east along the
        Alpine arc). New packs are regularly reported in Switzerland where there are
        about 150 wolves. More recently (2015) dispersing individuals from Dinaric-Balkans
        and the western Alps formed a pack in the central Alps. The total number in
        2015/2016 was estimated to be about 420-550 wolves (65 packs and 12 pairs;
        WAG 2018, Marucco \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e 2012); in 2017/18 it
        was estimated to be 550-700, increasing on average by 10-20% per year. The
        genetic continuity with the Apennines population has been recently assessed
        at 1.25-2.5 individuals per generation, all of them moving from the Apennines
        to the Alpine population (Fabbri \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e 2007).
        In 2005, a young radio-marked wolf dispersed more than 1,300 km from Parma
        (Italy) to Nice (France), providing a demonstration of the natural dispersal
        along the northern Apennines range to the Alps. In spite of the continuity
        between the two populations (Apennine and Alpine), their ecological and socio-economic
        contexts are sufficiently different to justify a separation into two functional
        population units for management purposes (LCIE 2007, Marucco \u003cem\u003eet

        Italian peninsula\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003ePopulation size: 2,020-2,645
        wolves (Aragno \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e 2022). The population was
        described in 1921 (Altobello 1921) and confirmed in 1999 (Nowak 1999) as a
        distinct subspecies (\u003cem\u003eCanis lupus italicus\u003c/em\u003e). It
        is genetically recognised by the presence of a unique mtDNA haplotype. After
        the population bottleneck of the 1960s, when total numbers were estimated
        to be about 100 animals, the population has steadily recovered throughout
        the Apennines and expanded into the western Alps. In 2006, the population
        was estimated to be 500-800; estimates in 2017 suggested numbers to be 1,100-2,400
        with an estimate of 1,600 probably being close to the real number. However,
        the difference between the 2006, 2017 and 2021 estimates are also due to improved
        estimation methods. The nearest population (apart from that in the western
        Alps, see above) is in Slovenia (Dinaric-Balkan population). Although a large
        portion of the central Alps and part of the agricultural Po River valley effectively
        separate the Italian peninsula and the Dinaric populations, the current trend
        suggests the inevitable continuity between them (Galaverni \u003cem\u003eet
        al.\u003c/em\u003e 2015, Boitani and Salvatori 2016).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.
        Dinaric-Balkan\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003ePopulation size: 5,000-5,500.
        There is continuity of the population and suitable habitats throughout the
        range although the population might be significantly sub-structured within
        this massive elongated range. Although the population is estimated to number
        about 5,000 individuals, locally the densities may vary greatly and its overall
        demographic trend is unknown. In Croatia and Slovenia, the population has
        recovered significantly following improved management in the 1990s. In Serbia
        and Bosnia-Herzegovina (Trbojević 2016) it is likely that the population has
        decreased in recent years due to overharvesting. To the north, the population
        has increasing functional contacts with the nearest population in Italy, and
        dispersing animals are reported in Austria. One dispersing male successfully
        established a pair and a territory in Veneto (northern Italy) with a mate
        from the western-central Alps population. To the east, the population may
        exchange individuals with the large wolf population of the Carpathians which
        extends into northern Bulgaria and eastern Serbia (Iliopoulos 1999; Kusak

        animals, the majority of them living in Romania and Ukraine. The differences
        between the 2006 and 2017 estimates are partly due to improved estimation
        methods. Slovakia hosts about 600 wolves and southern Poland contributes with
        good wolf habitat in the areas along its southern borders (the wolf population
        in the Polish Carpathians is about 300 individuals). In the past, there was
        natural continuity with wolves living in northern Poland and Belarus, but
        this link is now constrained by large areas where wolves have been exterminated.
        Nevertheless, it is likely that some level of genetic exchange still occurs
        with the Dinaric-Balkan population in western Bulgaria / eastern Serbia, and
        with the Baltic population in eastern-central Poland (Okarma 1993; CLCP 1997-98,

        and 1,600 in the adjacent Russian oblasts. At the start of the 20th century
        the population was greatly reduced, but still widely present, these increased
        during and after World War 1. In the period between the wars, populations
        were greatly reduced again, but recovered to peak levels during and after
        World War II, only to be heavily persecuted in the 1950s such that they again
        reached very low levels in the 1960s and early 1970s. The populations appear
        to have then increased, peaking in the early 1990s – before being reduced
        again in the late 1990s. This population is the westernmost portion of the
        large Russian population and it ultimately connects with the wolf range of
        Russian Karelia. In Poland, although the distribution is not continuous, it
        is highly likely that dispersal regularly connects the Baltic and Central
        European populations. The recent building of fences against human migrations

        Wolves were exterminated in Germany during the 19th century, but individuals
        that were dispersing from Poland were shot occasionally throughout the 20th
        century. In the late-1990s a pack began breeding in Saxony and there are now
        (2022) at least 160 packs. Wolves in western Poland have had a dynamic history
        of persecution and heavy harvest with periods of total absence and very low
        numbers in 1950 - 1990s, but since 2000 the population started to recover
        from immigrants originating in eastern Poland and presently there are about
        550 wolves in the region. Three packs were confirmed in Czechia in 2016 /2017

        and dispersing animals have reached Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands where
        the first packs are now permanently present. Connections exist to the Baltic
        population, but the distances are in the order of up to several hundred kilometres
        (Fechter and Storch 2015; Reinhardt \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e 2015;

        and their broad distribution ranges show the species'' adaptability to the
        most extreme (both in terms of natural and anthropogenic factors) habitat
        conditions. The wolf’s habitat has been prosaically described as anywhere
        where humans do not kill it and where there is something to eat. Where wolves
        depend on wild ungulate prey, their habitat is that of their prey. Habitat
        quality should thus be interpreted in terms of human disturbance, prey densities
        and range size. In general, large forest areas are particularly suitable for
        wolves in Europe, although wolves are not exclusively a forest species.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe
        wolf has a very diversified diet and is a true generalist that feeds opportunistically
        on what is most available in its habitat. The wolf’s diet may include large
        prey, such as Moose, Red Deer, Roe Deer and Wild Boar, as well as small mammals
        and birds, invertebrates, vegetation and carcasses. Diet composition throughout
        the geographic range and seasonal variations depend on the relative abundance
        of potential prey, as well as accessibility and availability. A wolf typically
        requires 3-5 kg of meat per day, although it can fast for several days when
        food is not readily available.","threats":"Human intolerance is perhaps the
        most important limiting factor facing wolves in Europe today. Fear, misunderstanding
        and the fact that wolves do kill livestock have prompted an uneasy relationship
        with people in many areas, leading to direct conflicts and retaliatory/preventative
        persecution. In some countries, poorly regulated hunting of wolves poses a
        threat, while in others licenses for killing wolves are issued irrespective
        of biological understanding. Poaching is widespread and probably represents
        the most important mortality factor for the wolf in many parts of Europe.
        Wolf depredation on domestic animals has been a problem since man progressed
        from hunter/gatherer to farmer, and although the numbers of sheep or cattle
        taken are, as a percentage, very low, livestock depredation remains the primary
        reason for persecuting wolves. Wolves have also become symbolic of wider issues
        of social change facing rural life, such that the politics of wolf management
        has become very controversial and intertwined with multiple other issues.
        It also appears that institutions in many countries are ill-equipped to handle
        the biological and socio-politic challenges of wolf management. Human land
        use is the most significant threat to wolf habitat. Wolves can live close
        to humans but they require safe areas in which to retreat. This is not always
        considered in land use planning in wolf areas and the small, fragmented populations
        in western Europe can result in animals moving into unsuitable habitats. Although
        wolves show a good ability to cross linear infrastructure like highways and
        railroads, these structures can be associated with wolf mortality and there
        is a need to ensure wildlife permeability in all infrastructure projects.
        Wolf-dog hybridisation has been increasingly reported in most European countries
        but only appears to be a major issue in Italy and other Mediterranean countries
        because of poor dog management practices. Legislation and public attitudes
        towards dog management and dog control policies impede the implementation
        of a coordinated effort to manage the occurrence and spread of hybridisation
        (Ciucci 2012). Another emerging threat is the border fences being built to
        control human migrations and the veterinary fences built to control the spread
        of the African swine fever in wild boar that have an increasingly serious
        impact on the connectivity towards the east and within the populations of
        several eastern and central European wolf populations. These fences will soon
        reduce the viability and conservation status of several wolf populations.
        Specific threats to different European wolf populations are as follows:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.
        Iberian\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIllegal killing is still common (estimated
        to account for 50% of the total mortality) and poison baits are still used.

        Western-Central Alps\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDocumented causes of
        mortality include car or train accidents and poaching. Several cases of illegal
        killing have been reported in France and Italy, and conflicts with hunters
        and farmers are constantly reported. Both France and the Regional Government
        of Piemonte have been carrying out extensive and continuous research and monitoring
        of the wolf population and damages to livestock, and excellent data is available
        for management purposes. The number of livestock depredations in the Italian
        Alps is decreasing, despite the increase in wolf numbers, due to the large
        efforts in the implementation of preventive practices promoted by the authorities.
        Although wolf presence is still far from being accepted by local farmers and
        livestock breeders, the general attitude is improving (\u003ca href=\"http://www.lifewolfalps.eu/\"\u003eLIFE

        (and rarely prosecuted) throughout the range. Poison baits are increasingly
        used against dogs, foxes and wolves. Hybridisation with dogs has been documented
        and, in certain areas of central Italy, it appears to account for up to 70%
        of the total wolf population (Verardi \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e

        of wolves throughout most of the range. Other pressures that are commonly
        reported include: habitat fragmentation due to the construction of fenced
        highways and a shortage of wild prey. In many countries, there is very limited
        knowledge about wolf ecology or status (Huber \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e

        Karelian\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe main threat to wolves in this
        region is killing by humans. In south-central Finland, wolves cause very limited
        damage to livestock, but predation on domestic dogs and a perception of competition
        for game species is the most frequent impact that causes strong resentment
        from the public. In the north of Finland, potential conflicts with semi-domestic

        dogs, sheep and semi-domestic reindeer are the most frequent damages that
        cause continuing debate on wolf conservation. In the north of Sweden and Norway,
        potential conflicts with semi-domestic reindeer herding effectively prevent
        its expansion. Norway has a restrictive policy that officially prevents further
        expansion.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9. Central European\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe
        main cause of documented mortality in Germany is traffic accidents (70%).
        Cases of illegal killing have been reported in Poland and Germany, and complaints
        from hunters and farmers are constantly reported from Germany. The implementation
        of livestock protection measures in Germany does not keep track with the fast
        population growth providing the ground for permanent and growing conflict
        with farmers, whereas such conflicts appear to be much less in the Polish
        population segment. The habitat is also very heavily modified and fragmented.
        Coordination between the federal states of Germany and between Germany and
        neighbouring countries is crucial.","measures":"By default, the species is
        strictly protected under the Bern Convention (Appendix II) and Habitats Directive
        (Annex II and IV), meaning that wolves may not be killed except under strict
        conditions, and key wolf habitat must be protected as part of the European
        protected area networks Natura 2000 (Habitats Directive, Annex II) and Emerald

        is required in some key areas (especially in southern Europe) in the form
        of fostering a healthy prey base and encouraging wolves to move back into
        their former range where appropriate. Conflicts with humans need to be addressed
        by involving local people in wolf management plans and through education programmes
        to increase people''s understanding of wolf biology and behaviour. Problems
        resulting from wolves preying on domestic animals need to be tackled by livestock
        protection schemes and compensation systems. In general, there is a need for
        innovative governance regimes that balance the need for large-scale (international
        level) coordination of management with the need to give local stakeholders
        a voice in local-level solutions to local problems. Finally, there is a need
        to increase investment in population monitoring in many countries in southern
        and eastern Europe where the largest populations live. Details of specific

        wolves were game species until 2021 and subject to various management regimes
        depending on the legislation of eight autonomous regional governments. Since
        2021, the wolf is nationally protected by law. The autonomous regions are
        gradually approving their action plans. Asturias has a wolf management plan
        and Galicia and Castilla y León also have approved their plans. However, management
        coordination among the regional governments and between Spain and Portugal
        is very limited. By allowing the (virtual) extinction of the Sierra Morena
        population in southern Spain, Spain has been in contravention of its obligations
        under the Habitats Directive’s Annex II and Annex IV regimes, and EU law requires

        the national Action Plans include provisions for the legal take of a certain
        number of wolves under strict conditions in response to damages on livestock.
        The three countries signed (2006) a formal agreement of cooperation for the
        management of the entire population, recognising that the biological population
        needs to be managed through a common and accepted approach, but the agreement

        but the effectiveness of compensation programmes has never been assessed and
        it is increasingly questioned. Apart from formal protection the population
        is not actively managed. The species occurs in several protected areas throughout

        to take a substantial portion of the population every year (up to 15-20%).
        A national Action Plan setting the broad strategic ground for management has

        conflicts that centre on wolf conservation.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8.
        Scandinavian\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eWolves are fully protected in
        Sweden and Norway; however, Norway applies both a zoning system and operates
        with a very low management goal that restricts wolves to a small area (\u003cem\u003ec\u003c/em\u003e.
        5% of the country) along the border with Sweden and prevents population expansion.
        Both Norway and Sweden provide full compensation for damages. Both countries
        greatly restrict the presence of wolves in the reindeer herding areas that
        cover the northern part of the peninsula. The main issue for the long-term
        viability of the population is inbreeding, which can only be improved by facilitating
        the movement of wolves through the northern reindeer herding areas of Norway,
        Sweden and Finland. Social and political conflicts around wolf management
        are intense.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9. Central European\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eWolves

        by the local authority but there is a certain degree of coordination at the

        of the 1960s and 1970s, the European Grey Wolf population is generally increasing
        in number and expanding its distribution range. Based on the best available
        data, in 2022, the total number of wolves in the 27 EU Member States is likely
        to be in the order of 19,000, and the number of wolves in the European assessment
        region (excluding Belarus and European Russia) is likely to exceed 21,500,
        a significant increase over the last five years (Boitani \u003cem\u003eet

        Iberian\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eNear Threatened. The Iberian population
        is large, about 2,500 individuals (2024-2990), and rather stable, slowly expanding
        towards the south and east. Although recently (2021) declared nationally protected
        in Spain, it is maintained in the  Near Threatened category because of fragmentation
        in management regimes, lack of a population-level management plan, the occurrence
        of largely unpredictable events of human persecution (poisoning, shooting,
        etc.) that may threaten the population at the local level and the near-isolation
        of some of its southern population segments.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.
        Western-Central Alps\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eNear Threatened. The
        Alpine population was founded based on a recent expansion of the Italian peninsula
        wolf population and has grown rapidly and steadily (10-20% /year) in each
        country of the Alpine arch. Accurate estimates from each country cannot be
        simply added up to estimate the population because an unknown % of wolves
        are shared among countries and the effect of running independent capture-recapture
        estimates could significantly inflate double counts. This concern is especially
        serious for the Italian-French part of the population. The total number of
        about 1,900 individuals should be considered as indicative. Dispersion over
        a large range, fragmentation among several countries, and the first signs
        of hybridisation (northeast in the western Alps of Italy and France, and eastern
        Alps of Italy) justify its assessment in the category Near Threatened.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.
        Italian peninsula\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eNear Threatened. The Italian
        peninsula wolf population is estimated to number 2,020-2,645 individuals.
        The shape of the range is narrow and elongated, mainly restricted to the Apennines
        Mountains. In spite of the recent increase in numbers and range, the Italian
        peninsula wolf population is locally vulnerable to local extermination from
        human pressures (poisoning, shooting) and the locally high prevalence of wolf-dog
        hybridisation. The stochastic nature of these events suggests that the current
        positive status of the population may easily be reversed.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.
        Dinaric-Balkan\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eLeast Concern. This wolf population
        does not qualify for any Threatened categories because of its large size (\u003cem\u003ec\u003c/em\u003e.
        5,000-5,500 individuals) and wide distribution. However, several parts of
        the range may be subject to excessive pressure from lethal control and poorly
        regulated hunting. In many countries the data quality is poor, and management
        plans are poorly developed or absent. Moreover, there are also very different
        management regimes amongst countries, lack of any compensation system in many
        of them (e.g. Albania, Bulgaria, Serbia, North Macedonia), lack of robust
        population monitoring in some of the countries (uncertainties on population
        estimates and trends), widespread poaching even in protected populations and
        probably excessive wolf hybridisation with dogs. It is worth noting that all
        cases of decreasing wolf population in Europe are from this population. There
        is an acute need for better data from throughout the southern part of this
        population.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. Carpathian\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eLeast
        Concern. This large wolf population (\u003cem\u003ec\u003c/em\u003e. 3,900-4,700
        individuals) appears to be maintaining its conservation status mainly due
        to the management implemented in Romania, Poland and the Slovak Republic.
        Some of the peripheral areas of the range may be subject to excessive hunting
        and poaching pressure (e.g. Hungary, Bulgaria) and may require appropriate
        conservation measures to limit mortality. In Poland and Czechia, wolves are
        fully protected while quotas for wolf hunting have decreased substantially
        in Slovakia. There is no common management plan at the population level and
        completely different management regimes are implemented in neighbouring countries
        (Ukraine, Poland, Slovak Republic, Hungary and Czechia).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6.
        Baltic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eLeast Concern. The relatively large
        (and increasing) number of wolves (\u003cem\u003ec\u003c/em\u003e. 2,190–2,790)
        in the EU member states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland) and the natural
        continuity of its range into the Russian Federation and Belarus support its
        assessment in the category of Least Concern. A large part of the population
        is fully protected in eastern Poland (1,040 wolves). However, portions of
        the population in some of the Baltic States are intensively hunted with high
        hunting quotas at 40-50% and may require careful monitoring to ensure their
        long-term persistence. The recent increase in solid border security fencing
        along the borders to Belarus and the Russian Federation are grounds for concern
        as they will decrease the degree of connectivity. Accurate monitoring is necessary
        as without this connectivity the population might be down-listed to Near Threatened.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7.
        Karelian\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eNear Threatened. The total population,
        shared by Finland and Russian Karelia is estimated to be 750 individuals and
        would qualify for Vulnerable under criterion D. However, the Karelian population
        is generally considered to have connections with the very large Russian population,
        and there could potentially be a rescue effect, so the population level assessment
        is downgraded by one step to Near Threatened. The total population in Finland
        is small (\u003cem\u003ec\u003c/em\u003e. 275 – 315) and it would qualify
        for the category of Endangered (D1) if it were isolated. The number of wolves
        in Russian Karelia is not well-known but is likely to be in the order of 500
        and may be declining as a result of excessive persecution. The degree of fragmentation
        is not known. Very little information is currently available on the status
        of the wolf in Russian Karelia, and this population should be reassessed if
        any new relevant data becomes available. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8.
        Scandinavian\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eVulnerable (D1). The population
        size is well known (550 of which 460 [364 – 598 95% CI] in Sweden) and the
        estimated number of mature individuals justifies the category Vulnerable.
        The population has low genetic variability due to a small number of founders
        and has little genetic exchange with the Karelian population. The management
        policies (low population goals and high hunting/control quotas) in Norway
        (and recently proposed in Sweden) dramatically affect the future conservation
        prospects of the overall population, and there is no common management plan
        at the population level.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9.
        Central European\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eNear Threatened. The population
        has grown very rapidly since 2000 and it is now estimated to number in the
        order of 1,850 individuals. This population is highly dynamic and dispersing
        animals have reached all Central European countries with confirmed packs established
        in Austria, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands. In the German part of the
        population, the expansion is mainly occurring in a north-westerly direction,
        whereas the expansion to the southwest is slower. Although the geographic
        gap between the Central European population and the Baltic population is nearly
        closed, genetic exchange between these populations still appears to be limited.
        New connections with the expanding populations in the Alps are also likely
        to occur soon. However, an increasing number of fences built to contain the
        spread of African Swine Fever may become a serious threat by contributing
        to population fragmentation.","trend_justification":null,"taxonomic_notes":null},"biogeographical_realms":[{"description":{"en":"Palearctic"},"code":"7"}],"conservation_actions":[{"note":"","code":"3_1_3","description":{"en":"Limiting
