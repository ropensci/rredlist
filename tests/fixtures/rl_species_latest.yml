        gorilla\u003c/em\u003e is found in Angola (Cabinda enclave), Cameroon, Central
        African Republic (CAR), mainland Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni), Gabon, Nigeria
        and Republic of Congo. Until recently, the core population had an almost continuous
        distribution from southern CAR to the Congo River and west to the coast. Rivers
        are the primary geographic barrier for this taxon, followed by habitat fragmentation:
        the two subspecies are separated by a major river (the Sanaga), and Western
        Lowland Gorillas are divided into subpopulations by other major rivers in
        the region (Anthony \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2007, Fünfstück \u003cem\u003eet
        al\u003c/em\u003e. 2014, Fünfstück and Vigilant 2015).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe
        northwestern limit of the western lowland subspecies distribution is the Sanaga
        River in Cameroon; the northern limit is the forest-savanna boundary to a
        maximum of roughly 6°N; the eastern limit is the Ubangi River; the Congo River
        south of its confluence with the Ubangi then becomes the southeastern and
        southern limits all the way to the coast. Small outlying populations of the
        Cross River subspecies remain on the Nigeria-Cameroon border at the headwaters
        of the Cross River and in the proposed Ebo National Park in Cameroon. Most
        Western Gorillas are found below 500 m asl, but those living on mountains
        occasionally reach elevations of 1,900 m asl.","population":"Estimates of
        Gorilla population size are usually made using a standard index of abundance:
        night nest abundance and distribution, sometimes combined with predictive

        carried out in 1990–2005 suggested that approximately 250–300 Cross River
        Gorillas persist in a forested area of roughly 12,000 km² (Bergl 2006, Oates
        \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2007). Monitoring of the Gorillas at multiple
        sites and genetic analysis at select locations (Arandjelovic \u003cem\u003eet
        al\u003c/em\u003e. 2015) has confirmed the small size of the subspecies population,
        while also documenting a larger geographic range than previously recorded
        (Bergl \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2012, Dunn \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e.
        2014). Cross River Gorillas occur in at least geographically distinct 11 localities
        (\u003cem\u003eibid\u003c/em\u003e.) Genetic evidence suggests that these
        subpopulations have had reproductive contact in the recent past (Bergl and
        Vigilant 2007); however, field surveys paired with remote sensing analysis
        reveal that forest corridors connecting subpopulations may no longer be functional
        as routes for dispersal (Imong \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2014).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eG.

        al\u003c/em\u003e. 2003, Bergl and Vigilant 2007). This distribution appears
        to be directly related to greater levels of human activity (especially poaching)
        in lowland areas, rather than selection of areas that provide preferred foods
        (Imong \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2013, Sawyer and Brashares 2013).

        markedly seasonal than that of other Gorilla populations) likely contributes
        to grouping and ranging patterns. Their diet reflects this seasonality, with
        terrestrial herbs and bark eaten as staples throughout the year, and fruit
        consumed during periods of seasonal abundance (McFarland 2007, De Vere \u003cem\u003eet

        is unknown. There is no birth season. Mean length of gestation is 256 days

        Infants suckle for 4–5 years, causing lactational amenorrhea in the mother.
        Interbirth intervals are 4–6 years. Western Gorillas appear to reproduce more
        slowly than Eastern Gorillas (\u003cem\u003eG. beringei\u003c/em\u003e). Maximum

        face similar threats, but to varying degrees in different regions.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003ePoaching\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e
        - Despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes
        is illegal, hunting for bushmeat is the primary driver of Western Gorilla
        decline. Current offtake levels are unsustainable – even legally-protected
        areas suffer high levels of poaching. The remaining population of Cross River
        Gorillas is small and fragmented, which puts each subpopulation at particular
        risk from poaching. While Gorillas do not generally appear to be targeted
        by hunters, it is estimated that opportunistic hunting removes at least 1–3
        Cross River Gorillas from the population each year. Additionally, snares targeting
        other species may trap Gorillas, causing injury or death. Until the mid-1990s,
        much of the Western Lowland Gorilla’s range included vast, roadless blocks
        of forest that were extremely difficult to access, where human population
        densities were very low and Gorilla densities high. In the last quarter century,
        however, almost all unprotected terra firma forest in this region has been
        allocated as logging concessions (Global Forest Watch 2016). This means that
        much of the once-remote, inaccessible forest is now covered by a network of
        logging roads (Laporte \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2007), which gives
        easy access to both hunters entering the forest and traffickers taking consignments
        of bushmeat (and ivory) out of the forest to distant destinations – often
        towns and cities where meat fetches high prices. Throughout Central Africa,
        mining permits for prospecting or resource extraction are being issued over
        an increasingly large surface area. As well as direct removal of Gorilla habitat,
        depending on the type of extraction, mining leads to very high rates of human
        immigration and the creation of yet more access roads, which are used for
        poaching (e.g., Edwards \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2014). The region’s
        governance is typically poor (Transparency International 2016); the weak law
        enforcement and corruption that enable poaching are evident in ivory trafficking
        (Bennett 2014), but also widespread elsewhere (Bour \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e.
        2013). In addition, huge road projects that will substantially fragment Gorilla
        habitat are currently underway (Laurance \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e.
        2015). The ease and speed of transport is now orders of magnitude higher than
        before the creation of such access roads, and hunting pressures are much higher.
        Across their range, Gorilla densities are lowest near roads, except where
        forest guards operate control points or roadblocks (Strindberg \u003cem\u003eet
        al\u003c/em\u003e. 2018). In addition, human populations in these once remote
        areas have grown, as people migrate to the employment opportunities offered
        by logging companies (Wilkie \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2000, Poulsen
        \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2009).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisease\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e
        - The second major driver of Western Lowland Gorilla decline is infectious
        disease, specifically Ebola virus disease (EVD). Surveys carried out from
        the 1980s to the present day show that there were a series of massive great
        ape die-offs in a large, mostly-intact forested area straddling the border
        between northeastern Gabon and northwestern Congo, which includes several
        national parks and logging concessions (Walsh \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e.
        2003; Maisels \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2004, 2013). Walsh \u003cem\u003eet
        al\u003c/em\u003e. (2008) estimated that three quarters of Western Lowland
        Gorillas in six protected areas affected by \u003cem\u003eEbolavirus\u003c/em\u003e
        were lost between 1995 and 2000. Typical mortality rate during the worst disease
        outbreaks was 95% (Bermejo \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2006, Caillaud
        \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2006). In protected areas, populations
        hit by disease began to recover within a decade (e.g., Genton \u003cem\u003eet
        al\u003c/em\u003e. 2012); however, total recovery would take 75–131 years
        in the absence of poaching, which is an unlikely scenario (Ryan and Walsh
        2011). Ebola virus has already been detected to the east of the Mambili River,
        a major river barrier between Odzala-Kokoua National Park and the Sangha River
        (Reed \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2014). Although rivers and forest
        fragmentation seem to present a partial barrier to the spread of Ebola, large
        numbers of Gorillas could be wiped out in a short space of time, as transmission
        between individuals is rapid and large areas can be affected by a single outbreak
        (Walsh \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2007, 2009). The small size of
        the Cross River population means it is also highly vulnerable to infectious
        disease. \u003cem\u003eEbolavirus\u003c/em\u003e has not been reported in
        the Cross River Gorillas, but their close proximity to dense human populations
        and livestock heightens the risks of disease transmission (Dunn \u003cem\u003eet
        al\u003c/em\u003e. 2014).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eHabitat
        degradation and destruction\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - Habitat loss
        is emerging as a major threat to Western Gorillas. As oil-palm plantations
        in Asia reach capacity, Africa is becoming the new frontier for this crop,
        offering excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall,
        soil and temperatures (Rival and Lavang 2014). Unfortunately, such areas coincide
        with good Gorilla habitat: 73.8% of the Western Lowland Gorilla’s range is
        considered suitable for oil palm (Wich \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e.
        2014). The recent expansion of industrial-scale mineral extraction and the
        creation of open-pit mines are of great concern (Edwards \u003cem\u003eet
        al\u003c/em\u003e. 2014, Lanjouw 2014), and also lead to the establishment
        of development corridors, which can be several kilometres wide and add to
        areas of “lost forest” (Laurance \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2015).
        There is a disconnect between the various bodies responsible for land-use
        planning in the realms of conservation, mining and agriculture in all Western
        Gorilla range states except Gabon. Consequently, there is increasing competition
        for land between long-term conservation needs and immediate financial gain
        as governments explore the potential of clearing natural habitat in favour
        of economic development. Without careful and immediate land-use planning that
        involves cooperation between the government bodies responsible for protected
        areas and wildlife on one hand, and economic and agricultural development
        on the other, large areas of Western Lowland Gorilla habitat could be cleared
        within a few decades. The lack of effective protected area management throughout
        much of the Cross River Gorilla’s range combined with the lack of protected
        status for much of the Gorillas’ habitat in Cameroon, threatens the future
        availability of habitat suitable for the population. Conversion of forest
        for agriculture and grazing is occurring rapidly in many parts of the Gorillas’
        range and the largest protected areas in which Cross River Gorillas occur
        contain enclaves of human settlements whose farmlands have spread beyond their
        legal boundaries. Expansion of these settlements and associated development
        of access routes in the form of roads and bridges inside the protected areas
        exacerbate subdivision of the Cross River Gorilla population. In both Cameroon
        and Nigeria, the construction and improvement of roads outside protected areas
        also threatens to increase subdivision of Gorilla populations through habitat
        disturbance and intensification of forest resource extraction. Increasing
        access will also exacerbate poaching pressure. While most habitat loss in
        the region is the result of small-scale agriculture, commercial logging and
        industrial agriculture (e.g., for oil palm) are also impending threats.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eClimate

        subspecies of Western Gorilla, as it is already thought to be affecting the
        Central African tropical moist forests (Lewis \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e.
        2013). Although the likely impacts of global climate change are not yet known,
        some predictions suggest a drying of this region with potentially negative
        consequences for forest ecology, such as changes in fruit and flower phenology,
        forest productivity and increased vulnerability to fire, and even forest retreat
        (James et al. 2013). Seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature, and
        weather extremes are likely ongoing and set to continue (Lovett 2015). Negative
        impacts on great apes have already been predicted (Lehmann \u003cem\u003eet
        al\u003c/em\u003e. 2010), particularly along the coast (Korstjens \u003cem\u003eet
        al\u003c/em\u003e. 2010). Climate change is the least likely factor for which
        effective action for great apes and for African tropical forests in general
        can be taken in a timely manner. Climate talks in 2015 resulted in international
        cooperative agreement between most of the world’s nations regarding the need
        for action; however, the task of reversing, or even flattening current temperature
        trends will be extremely challenging.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor more

        gorilla\u003c/em\u003e has a large geographic range, covering over 700,000
        km². The size of the population in 2013 was estimated to be almost 362,000
        individuals\u0026#160; (Strindberg \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2018).
        Only a very small number of Western Gorillas are the \u003cem\u003eG. g. diehli\u003c/em\u003e
        subspecies, therefore this rationale focuses on the \u003cem\u003eG. g. gorilla\u003c/em\u003e
        subspecies. The country of Gabon lost over half its Gorilla population between
        1983 and 2000 (Walsh \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e. 2003). More recent
        population declines have been estimated using a predictive model that incorporated
        survey data collected between 2003 and 2013 across the entire range of Western
        Lowland Gorillas. The results reveal an 19.4% decline between 2005 and 2013,
        corresponding to an annual loss of ~2.7% (Strindberg \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e.
        2018). These population decreases were driven by poaching and disease (\u003cem\u003eEbolavirus\u003c/em\u003e)
        outbreaks.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eDespite their abundance and wide geographic
        range, Western Gorillas qualify as Critically Endangered under criterion A:
        a population reduction of more than 80% over three generations (one generation
        is ~22 years). This listing is based on ongoing population losses due to illegal
        hunting, disease and habitat loss: poaching is intensifying with the expansion
        of access routes into forests and Zaire \u003cem\u003eEbolavirus\u003c/em\u003e
        remains a highly significant threat. At a conservative rate of reduction (2.7%
        per year rather than 4%, calculated from Walsh \u003cem\u003eet al\u003c/em\u003e.
        2003), the reduction in the Western Gorilla population is predicted to exceed
        80% over three generations (i.e., 66 years, 2005–2071). Illegal hunting has
        not ceased despite intense anti-poaching efforts, and the threat of \u003cem\u003eEbolavirus\u003c/em\u003e
        has not been removed. In addition, the scale of habitat conversion to industrial
        agriculture will increase, and the effects of climate change will become more
        evident. \u003cem\u003eGorilla gorilla\u003c/em\u003e thus qualifies as Critically
        Endangered (A4bcde).","trend_justification":null,"taxonomic_notes":"\u003cp\u003eThe

        Sarmiento and Oates 2000, Groves 2001). Genetic data suggest that the two

        populations in Ebo (Cameroon) awaits clarification; however, measurements
