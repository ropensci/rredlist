        reflects the species\u0026#39; threatened status, rather than indicating a
        large decline from its historical state; in fact, the species is expected
        to occur in similar numbers today as it has for centuries. The island is difficult
        to access, and while some hunting may take place occasionally, it is unlikely
        to pose a major threat; therefore, past and planned conservation actions are
        minimal, and the species Conservation Legacy, Conservation Dependence, and
        Conservation Gain are all Zero. Nonetheless, there is a relatively high probability
        that a stochastic event (in this case, a fire) could drive the species to
        extinction within 20 years; therefore, all future scenarios include the possibility
        of extinction. Because the population currently fluctuates around carrying

        unit, is not currently Viable. The Sardinian Currant has a Conservation Legacy
        and Conservation Gain of Zero; past attempts to bolster the wild population

        is a High Conservation Dependence; if conservation actions were to stop, it
        is expected that the species would likely go extinct over a 10-year period.
        Finally, with effective protection and successful translocations, within 100
