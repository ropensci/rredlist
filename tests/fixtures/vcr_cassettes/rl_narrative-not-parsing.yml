        species has experienced rapid declines across most of its European range.
        Population trends outside Europe are unknown. Extrapolated over three generation
        lengths and allowing for uncertainty, the population is thought to be declining
        at a rate sufficient to trigger Vulnerable under the population size criterion.
        Should population trends become less uncertain both within and outside its
        European range it may merit uplisting or downlisting.","geographicrange":"The
        Atlantic Puffin can be found throughout the North Atlantic Ocean, from north-west
        Greenland (<strong>to </strong><strong>Denmark</strong>) to the coastline
        of Newfoundland (<strong>Canada</strong>) and Maine (<strong>USA</strong>)
        in the west, and from north-west <strong>Russia&#160;</strong>down to the
        Canary Islands, <strong>Spain</strong> (in winter) in the east (del Hoyo <em>et
        al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. The population in <strong>Iceland</strong>
        and <strong>Norway</strong>, which together account for 80% of the European
        population, decreased markedly since the early 2000s (BirdLife International
        2015).&#160;In much of Iceland breeding has generally failed every year since
        2003, but in the north, at least, it has been borderline sustainable (G. A.
        Gudmundsson&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015, E. Hansen <em>in litt. </em>2016,
        A. Petersen <em>in litt. </em>2016). The largest Norwegian colony, Røst, has
        experienced sharp declines&#160;from almost 1.5 million breeding pairs in
        1979 to only 289,000 pairs in 2015, and has produced virtually no chicks in
        the last 9 years&#160;(T. Anker-Nilssen <em>in litt</em>. 2015, Anker-Nilssen
        <em>et al. </em>2016). Most other Norwegian colonies are much smaller, including
        that at Runde, which has also declined; however most colonies remain unmonitored
        (A. O. Folkestad&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015, T. Anker-Nilssen <em>in litt</em>.
        2015, 2016). Numbers on the southern coast of the Barents Sea have increased
        such that declines in the total population in Norway are estimated at approximately
        33% since the early 1980s (Fauchald <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;Populations
        in the Faroe Islands (Denmark) and Greenland are also reported to be decreasing
        (BirdLife International 2015).<br/>The population size was estimated to be
        increasing in the U.K. during 1969-2000, and populations in the North Sea
        are probably currently stable or increasing after a decline in the 2000s due
        to two very low overwinter survivals of adults (Harris and Wanless 2011,&#160;<a>Harris
        <em>et al.</em> 2013</a>).&#160;A reduction in the recruitment of juveniles
        into the breeding population is thought to be the most likely factor involved
        in a sharp decrease in the number of puffins at the Fair Isle (U.K.) breeding
        colony; from approximately 20,200 individuals in 1986 to 10,700 individuals
        in 2012 (Miles&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Adult survival probability remained
        similar across the 27 years of the study, whilst breeding success, the number
        of feeding visits by adults to chicks and the size of available prey fish
        all decreased. Trends from North America are uncertain, with the population
        at Great Island, Witless Bay showing increases between 1979 and 1994, but
        it has potentially stabilised or is in decline now (Wilhelm <em>et al. </em>2015).
        A restoration project off the coast of Maine has also had some success (D.
        Wege <em>in litt. </em>2002, see&#160;http://projectpuffin.audubon.org/).<p></p>","population":"The
        European population is estimated to be 4,770,000-5,780,000 pairs, which equates
        to 9,550,000-11,600,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).","populationtrend":"decreasing","habitat":"The
        species is exclusively marine, found on rocky coasts and offshore islands
        (Nettleship <em>et al</em>. 2014). It nests on grassy maritime slopes, sea
        cliffs and rocky slopes. During the winter it is wide-ranging, found in offshore
        and pelagic habitats.<br/><br/>The species is a pursuit-diver, catching most
        of its prey within 30 m of the water surface but&#160;capable of diving to
        60 m (Piatt and Nettleship 1985, Burger and Simpson 1986)<sup></sup>. They
        prey on ''forage'' species, including juvenile pelagic fishes, such as herring
        <em>Clupea harengus</em>, juvenile and adult capelin <em>Mallotus</em> <em>villosus</em>,
        and sandeel <em>Ammodytes</em> spp. (Barrett <em>et al</em>. 1987)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.
        At times, they also prey on juvenile demersal fishes, such as gadids; planktonic
        crustaceans; and polychaete worms (Harris and Hislop 1978, Barrett <em>et
        al. </em>1987, Martin 1989, Rodway and Montevecchi 1996, Harris <em>et al.
        </em>2015)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In the southern and eastern parts
        of its range, sandeels usually form the majority of the prey fed to chicks
        (Corkhill 1973, Hislop and Harris 1985, Harris and Wanless 1986, Martin 1989,
        Harris and Riddiford 1989).&#160;However, there are exceptions, such as at
        Skomer Island in 1969 when sprat made up the majority of the diet fed to chicks
        (Corkhill 1973), and in the Lofoten islands, where first-year herring are
        often the commonest food of chicks (Anker-Nilssen and Aarvak 2006).<br/><br/>When
        feeding chicks, birds generally forage within 10 km of their colony, but may
        range as far as 50 to 100 km or more (Harris 1984,&#160;Anker-Nilssen and
        Lorentsen 1990,&#160;Rodway and Montevecchi 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.
        A boat transect run on one day in 1970 found that 85% of all birds seen were
        concentrated within just 3 km of the colony (BirdLife International 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>,
        but other studies have found peaks in the density of foraging birds at up
        to 40 km distance from the colony (Webb <em>et al.</em> 1985, Stone <em>et
        al.</em> 1992, Stone <em>et al. </em>1993, BirdLife International 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.
        Similarly, surveys and GPS tracking at the Isle of May, Scotland, suggest
        that birds forage close to the breeding colony, but also at other sites up
        to 40 km away (Wanless <em>et al.</em> 1990, BirdLife International 2000,
        Harris <em>et al. </em>2012)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Various studies
        (Pearson 1968, Corkhill 1973, Bradstreet and Brown 1985, BirdLife International
        2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, based on different breeding colonies, have
        estimated the theoretical maximum foraging radius at anywhere from 32 km (Corkhill
        1973)<strong><sup></sup></strong> to 200 km (Bradstreet and Brown 1985). <p></p>","threats":"This
        species is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as sea
        temperature rise and shifts in prey distribution and abundance (Durant <em>et
        al</em>. 2003, Sandvik <em>et al</em>. 2005). This is a particularly important
        threat when prey species are exploited unsustainably, leading to prey reductions
        and subsequent unsuccessful breeding.&#160;Breeding failures are usually assumed
        to be due to food shortages (e.g. Martin 1989, Anker-Nilssen and Aarvak 2006,
        Harris and Wanless 2011, Anker-Nilssen <em>et al.</em> 2016). It is vulnerable
        to oil spills and other marine pollution. Extreme weather events and storms
        also pose a threat, with large wrecks recorded following severe winter storms
        at sea. At the breeding colonies the species is vulnerable to invasive predators,
        such as rats, cats, and American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>. The species
        is susceptible to being caught in gillnets, although other fishing gears may
        also catch significant numbers. Increasing numbers of offshore wind farms
        may result in displacement from habitat, although the risk of collision is
        considered very low (Bradbury <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is hunted
        for human consumption in Iceland, and in the Faroe Islands (Thorup <em>et
        al</em>. 2014). Harvesting, livestock grazing and tourism&#160;at its breeding
        grounds pose additional threats due to disturbance (Nettleship <em>et al</em>.
        2014).","conservationmeasures":"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions
        Underway</strong><br/>The species is listed under the African Eurasian Waterbird
        Agreement. It is included in the Action Plan for Seabirds in Western-Nordic
        Areas (TemaNord 2010). There are 76 marine Important Bird Areas identified
        across the European region. Within the EU there are 40 Special Protection
        Areas which list this species as occurring within its boundaries.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation
        and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Further identification of important
        sites for this species, particularly in offshore regions and designation as
        marine protected areas. Increase knowledge of the species''s ecological requirements
        in winter (Harris <em>et al. </em>2015). Develop a monitoring schemes to understand
        population trends (Nettleship <em>et al</em>. 2014). Identify the risks of
        different activities on seabirds, and locations sensitive to seabirds.&#160;Continue
        eradication of invasive predators from breeding colonies. Management of fisheries
        to ensure long-term sustainability of key stocks (e.g. sandeels). Establish
        observer schemes for bycatch and prepare National/Regional plans of action
        on seabird bycatch. Continue Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)
        monitoring of seabird contaminants; include new contaminants and secure communication
        between seabird and contaminants research.&#160;Develop a system to monitor
        and predict impacts of offshore oil developments on important areas for the
        species, in particular, key wintering sites (Nettleship&#160;<em>et al</em>.
        2014).&#160;Increase the level of understanding among the public of introducing
        hunting restrictions. Develop codes-of-conduct for more organised activities
        (e.g. tourism). Ensure that appropriate protection (national laws and international
        agreements) applies to new areas and times in cases of changes in seabird
        migration routes and times.","usetrade":null}]}'
