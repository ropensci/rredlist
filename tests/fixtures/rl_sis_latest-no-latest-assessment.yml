        Australian endemic occurs in a strip along the coast in the southwest and

        It is also on Dirk Hartog Island. The estimated altitudinal range of the species

        species is found in course-grained coastal sand dunes. It relies on moisture
        in the sand and rainfall. It burrows in the soft sand and shelters up to 10cm
        underground. It is active in the winter months when it emerges from the burrow
        to feed. Males call in the spring. Pairs spend summer together underground
        and then eggs are deposited in Autumn (April). Large eggs are laid in deep
        burrows up to 80cm under the ground in moist sand. There is no free-swimming
        tadpole and tiny frogs hatch from the eggs after about 2 months.","threats":"There
        is no human infrastructure development within the species'' range as there
        is no freshwater and the coastline is comprised of cliffs. There is a minor
        threat from cattle grazing in the range. Desiccation through drought is a
        possible threat. But overall, this species is not significantly threatened.","measures":"It
