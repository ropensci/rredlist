`rredlist` is an R client for the IUCN Red List API (https://api.iucnredlist.org). The [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/) is the world’s most comprehensive information source on the global extinction risk status of animal, fungus, and plant species. This package provides access via R to the various data contained within this database which span range details, population size, habitat and ecology, use and/or trade, threats, and conservation actions. The functions within the package cover all endpoints of the IUCN Red List web API, which are documented [here](https://api.iucnredlist.org/api-docs/index.html).

## Installation

CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rredlist")
```

Development version

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropensci/rredlist")
# OR
install.packages("rredlist", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/")
```

## Authentication

Use of this package requires an IUCN API key which can be acquired at https://api.iucnredlist.org/users/sign_up. There is a helper function to help you get the key and store it properly:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rredlist::rl_use_iucn()
```

**Keep this key private.** You can pass the key in to each function via the key parameter, but it’s better to store the key either as an environment variable (`IUCN_REDLIST_KEY`) or an R option (`iucn_redlist_key`) - we recommend using the former option. Note that there is not a default API key that is used as a fallback, and the package will not function without providing/storing your own API key.

## Example usage

### Loading the package
```{r}
library("rredlist")
```

### Search for assessments for a particular species
```{r output.lines=1:10}
rl_species("Gorilla", "gorilla")$assessments
```

### Search for assessments that recommend particular conservation actions

#### Get a list of all conservation actions
```{r output.lines=1:10}
rl_actions()
```

#### Return assessments with a particular conservation action
```{r output.lines=1:10}
rl_actions("2_2", all = FALSE)$assessments
```
