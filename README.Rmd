`rredlist` is an R client for the IUCN Red List (<http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/docs>). 
The IUCN Red List is a global list of threatened and endangered species.

[IUCN Red List docs][docs]

> important note: [redlistr][] is a different package - not working with the IUCN Red List API

> Note: there can sometimes be a discrepancy between what you get on the IUCN website and what
> you get with this package; we don't know why, the IUCN API is not an open book.

## Citing the IUCN Red List API

See <http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/about>

## Authentication

IUCN requires you to get your own API key, an alphanumeric string that you need to send in every request. There's an helper function in the package helping you getting it at <http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/token> and storing it.

```{r}
rredlist::rl_use_iucn()
```

Keep this key private. You can pass the key in to each function via the `key` parameter, but it's better to store the key either as a environment variable (`IUCN_REDLIST_KEY`) or an R option (`iucn_redlist_key`) - we recommend using the former option.

## High vs. Low level package APIs

__High level API__

High level functions do the HTTP request and parse data to a data.frame for
ease of downstream use. The high level functions have no underscore on the end
of the function name, e.g., `rl_search`

__Low level API__

The parsing to data.frame in the high level API does take extra time. The low
level API only does the HTTP request, and gives back JSON without doing any
more parsing. The low level functions DO have an underscore on the end
of the function name, e.g., `rl_search_`

## No Spatial

This package does not include support for the spatial API, described at
<http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/spatial>.

## Rate Limiting

From the IUCN folks: "Too many frequent calls, or too many calls per day
might get your access blocked temporarily. If you're a heavy API user, the
Red List Unit asked that you contact them, as there might be better options.
They suggest a 2-second delay between your calls if you plan to make a
lot of calls."

## Citing IUCN API

use the function `rl_citation()`

```{r}
rl_citation()
```


## Install

CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rredlist")
```

Development version

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rredlist")
```

```{r}
library("rredlist")
```

## High level API

High level functions do the HTTP request and parse to data to a data.frame for ease
of downstream use.

```{r}
rl_search('Fratercula arctica')
```

Likely a bit faster is to parse to a list only, and not take the extra data.frame parsing time

```{r output.lines=1:10}
rl_search('Fratercula arctica', parse = FALSE)
```

## Low level API

The parsing to data.frame in the high level API does take extra time. The low level API
only does the HTTP request, and gives back JSON without doing any more parsing

```{r}
rl_search_('Fratercula arctica')
```

To consume this JSON, you can use `jsonlite`

```{r}
library("jsonlite")
jsonlite::fromJSON(rl_search_('Fratercula arctica'))
```

Or other tools, e.g., `jq` via the `jqr` R client

```{r output.lines=1:20}
# devtools::install_github("ropensci/jqr")
library("jqr")
rl_search_('Fratercula arctica') %>% dot()
```
